# Clinical Domain Agent (CDA)

The CDA is designed to handle the secure deidentification, pseudonymization and transfer of clinical
FHIR resources. It ensures that sensitive patient information is appropriately anonymized before
being transferred between systems, supporting interoperability in healthcare while safeguarding
patient privacy. It plays a crucial role in the overall data transfer process, working in
collaboration with the Research Domain Agent (RDA) and Trust Center Agent (TCA) to facilitate
controlled and privacy-aware data exchange.
