# Research Domain Agent (RDA)

The RDA manages the secure transfer of deidentified research-focused FHIR resources. It is
responsible for receiving and processing deidentified data from the Clinical Domain Agent (CDA) and
facilitating its integration into research FHIR servers. By ensuring compliance with the SMITH
architecture, RDA supports the interoperability of research data while preserving patient
confidentiality.
